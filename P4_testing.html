                school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well </p>

            <h2 id='response'>7. Our Response</h2>
            <p>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for improvements
                are difficult or impossible to tackle.

            <h2 id='reflection'>8. Self-reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that you have learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful about
                your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
